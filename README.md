**Why?** We are currently in 2017. Several hundred thousand platforms are available on the e-commerce market.

Why, then, I am building next one?

Because the author of this code is hungry for knowledge and... the next challenges :-)

And he wants to test his skills by doing something cool.

## Warning:

This code is REALLY a developmental version which is not suitable for any production application.
